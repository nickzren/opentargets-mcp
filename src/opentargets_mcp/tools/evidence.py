        **When to use**
        - Audit the individual evidence components supporting a targetâ€“disease association
        - Filter results by datasource to focus on genetic, literature, or clinical sources
        - Implement paginated evidence views within conversational agents

        **When not to use**
        - Summarising association scores only (see target/disease association tools)
        - Exploring biomarkers specifically (use `get_target_disease_biomarkers`)

        **Parameters**
        - `client` (`OpenTargetsClient`): GraphQL client instance.
        - `ensembl_id` (`str`): Target identifier (`"ENSG..."`).
        - `efo_id` (`str`): Disease identifier (`"EFO..."`/`"MONDO..."`).
        - `datasource_ids` (`Optional[List[str]]`): Restrict to specific datasource IDs (e.g., `["eva", "ot_crispr"]`).
        - `size` (`int`): Maximum evidence rows to return per page (default 10).
        - `cursor` (`Optional[str]`): Cursor token from a previous call for pagination.

        **Returns**
        - `Dict[str, Any]`: `{"target": {"evidences": {"count": int, "cursor": str, "rows": [{"id": str, "score": float, "datasourceId": str, "datatypeId": str, ...}], ...}}}`.
